# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploration to insights generation and visualization. The goal is to analyze a dataset using Python and SQL, transform it into meaningful insights, and present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard and a professional report and presentation.

The project showcases skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, data visualization, and business-focused reporting.

---

## Dataset

* The dataset contains structured data relevant to business analysis.
* Data was loaded and analyzed using Python.
* Cleaning steps were applied to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* The cleaned dataset was stored and queried using a PostgreSQL database.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

  * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **PostgreSQL** – Data storage and SQL analysis
* **SQL** – Querying and aggregating data for insights
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma AI** – Presentation (PPT) creation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and documentation

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
   * Performed initial inspection and validation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distributions, trends, and outliers.
   * Identified key patterns and relationships.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates.
   * Standardized data types and formats.
   * Prepared clean data for database storage.

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL server.
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer business-focused questions.
   * Performed aggregations and filtering for insights.

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.
   * Built interactive visualizations and KPIs.
   * Designed a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a detailed analytical report.
   * Built a professional presentation using Gamma AI to communicate insights clearly.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend and comparison charts
* Filters for interactive exploration
* Business-relevant insights for decision-making

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data.
* Highlighted actionable insights to support business decisions.
* Presented findings in both visual and written formats for technical and non-technical audiences.
